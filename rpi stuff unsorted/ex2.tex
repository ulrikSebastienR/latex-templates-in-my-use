\section{Some Useful LaTeX Environments}
\subsection{Center Environment}
If you have several lines to be centered horizontally,
the \texttt{center} environment is convenient.  The example below
produces three lines, each horizontally centered.
\begin{center}
  This is line one. \\
  This is line two. \\
  This is line three.
\end{center}

\subsection{Quotations}
\begin{quote}
\small          % a smaller font will be used inside this environment
The quote environment begins a new line and indents text from
both sides.
Any special effects (such as changes to the type size or style) 
started within the quote environment are terminated by the end of the environment.

New paragraphs are block style: that is, no indent and a blank line
as separation.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The List Environments}
The following list illustrates the description environment:
\begin{description}
  \item[enumerate] Puts numbers in front of the items
  \item[itemize] Puts bullets in front of the items
  \item[description] Puts words in front of the items
\end{description}

Here is what the enumerate environment looks like:
\begin{enumerate}     
  \item This is the first item
  \item This is the second item.
  \item This is the third item.
\end{enumerate}

% How would you make the itemize environment?
% Duplicate the lines above, which produce the enumerate environment,
% copying them to the space below these comments.
% Then make the changes necessary to use the itemize environment.
% Also, uncomment the next line:
